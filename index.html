                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Xiyu Li, a passionate <b>Data Analyst</b> with a strong academic background in statistics and computer science, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science at <b>Johns Hopkins University</b> (expected graduation in May 2025). I hold a B.A. in Statistics and Computer Science from Macalester College, where I developed my skills in <b>machine learning</b>, <b>statistical modeling</b>, and <b>data visualization</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve led and contributed to diverse data-driven projects, including a comprehensive flight delay prediction analysis, where my team successfully built predictive models with over 82% accuracy. My work spans across transportation data analysis, spatial crime mapping, and real-time ECG recognition, demonstrating my expertise in data wrangling, modeling, and visualization using tools such as <b>Python</b>, <b>R-Studio</b>, <b>Tableau</b>, and <b>PowerBI</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With experience in both academic and industry settings, I am proficient in applying machine learning techniques, statistical analysis, and data-driven solutions to real-world problems. I am always excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to innovative projects that have a meaningful impact.
                </p>

            <p>
                This project examines eight years of crime data across 17 neighborhoods to identify spatial and demographic crime patterns. Using exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, the study employs Lasso regression for predictor selection and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to enhance prediction accuracy. Moran’s I-test is used to detect spatial correlations in residuals, ensuring robust model performance. Findings contribute to a deeper understanding of crime distribution and potential policy interventions.
