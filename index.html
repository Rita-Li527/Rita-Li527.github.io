<p>Hello! </p>
<p>My Name is <strong>Xiyu Li</strong>. You can also call me <strong>Rita</strong>. This is my personal website. </p>
<p>I am a first-year data science master's student at Johns Hopkins University. I completed my bachelor's degree at Macalester College, double majoring in Statistics and Computer Science. </p>
<p>During my undergraduate study, I prepared myself for a career in Data Science by taking a wide range of relevant courses and practicing through projects.</p>
<p>Last summer, I had my first internship at an energy reliability company as a Data Analyst intern,
responsible for improving the data analysis part of the company's annual reports. Though lacking
previous experience in the energy industry, I familiarized myself with the basic knowledge and
terminology of energy reliability in a short period through self-tutoring and attending internal
meetings and webinars. By the end of the internship, I developed new forms to organize and
analyze data as well as data visualization for three different data systems and gave a presentation
within the company. This experience gave me confidence in my adaptability and ability to learn
quickly in future jobs</p>
