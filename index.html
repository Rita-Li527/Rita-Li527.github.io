                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Xiyu Li, a passionate <b>Data Analyst</b> with a strong academic background in statistics and computer science, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science at <b>Johns Hopkins University</b> (expected graduation in May 2025). I hold a B.A. in Statistics and Computer Science from Macalester College, where I developed my skills in <b>machine learning</b>, <b>statistical modeling</b>, and <b>data visualization</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve led and contributed to diverse data-driven projects, including a comprehensive flight delay prediction analysis, where my team successfully built predictive models with over 82% accuracy. My work spans across transportation data analysis, spatial crime mapping, and real-time ECG recognition, demonstrating my expertise in data wrangling, modeling, and visualization using tools such as <b>Python</b>, <b>R-Studio</b>, <b>Tableau</b>, and <b>PowerBI</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With experience in both academic and industry settings, I am proficient in applying machine learning techniques, statistical analysis, and data-driven solutions to real-world problems. I am always excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to innovative projects that have a meaningful impact.
                </p>

            <p>
            This project explores factors contributing to flight delays in the U.S. and develops predictive models to improve airline scheduling and operational efficiency. Using a dataset of over 100 million records, the analysis identifies key predictors such as flight schedules, airport characteristics, and weather conditions. Machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are employed to forecast delays, with Bayesian methods further enhancing accuracy. The project aims to provide data-driven insights to minimize disruptions, reduce costs, and improve overall passenger experience.

            <p>
                This project analyzes differences between AI-generated and human-written text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging BERT models and FLESCH readability scores, the study examines text homogeneity, feature variation, and linguistic complexity. Informative visualizations provide insights into AI-generated content patterns, helping improve AI text evaluation and generation processes.

            <p>
                This project investigates the relationship between gas prices and public transportation ridership over a three-year period. By integrating daily ridership data with gas price trends, the analysis explores how fuel costs impact commuting behavior. Statistical modeling techniques, including linear regression and Linear Mixed Models, are applied to assess trends and correlations. The project also features an interactive R Shiny app with a Leaflet map, offering dynamic visualizations to aid transportation planners in optimizing services and policies.

            <p>
                This project examines eight years of crime data across 17 neighborhoods to identify spatial and demographic crime patterns. Using exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, the study employs Lasso regression for predictor selection and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to enhance prediction accuracy. Moran’s I-test is used to detect spatial correlations in residuals, ensuring robust model performance. Findings contribute to a deeper understanding of crime distribution and potential policy interventions.
